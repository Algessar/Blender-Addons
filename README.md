This is a work in progress. I can only guarantee that Converter_V3 is working. 


Rigify Game Rig Converter:

A generic converter for Rigify, to transform any generated rig into a working game rig.

The script is fully agnostic to which type of metarig is used. 

Just select your generated rig and make sure the metarig is visible in the scene (it is used for the conversion!).

You can decide if you want to have 4 limb bones or 2 with the split bones bool.
