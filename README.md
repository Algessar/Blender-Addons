# Blender Addons
 
This shit's bugged yo. There's a hacky solution for import errors (I'm getting the AppData folder and directly pointing the imports to blender V 4.2. Don't judge. But do feel free to help me fix it.
This probably broke things, since the Convert to Game Rig operator stopped working when I tested it as an actual addon. More things are likely to be broken.
